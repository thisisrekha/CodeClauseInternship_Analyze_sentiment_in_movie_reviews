PROJECT TITLE: ANALYZE SENTIMENT IN MOVIE REVIEWS

AIM :
Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

DESCRIPTION :
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and build a sentiment analysis model.

PROJECT OVERVIEW :
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis and customer segmentation on movie reviews. The goal is to categorize reviews into positive and negative sentiments using machine learning and unsupervised clustering.

STEPS TAKEN:

IMPORT LIBRARIES :
Essential libraries such as NLTK, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are imported for data processing, machine learning, and visualization.

DOWNLOAD DATASET :
The movie_reviews dataset from NLTK is downloaded. This dataset contains positive and negative movie reviews categorized into different classes.

LOAD & PREPROCESS DATA :
Load the movie reviews and preprocess the text data.
Perform text preprocessing tasks such as removing stopwords, converting words to lowercase, and shuffling the documents for randomness.

FEATURE EXTRACTION :
Extract features (words) and labels (positive/negative) from the preprocessed data.
Use TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features suitable for clustering.

MODEL TRAINING - K-MEANS CLUSTERING :
Implement K-Means clustering to segment the movie reviews based on their TF-IDF vector representations.
Find the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method (WCSS) to determine the appropriate number of clusters.

MODEL EVALUATION :
Evaluate the clustering model by visualizing the clusters and centroids.
Analyze how reviews are grouped based on their sentiment and textual content.

TECHNOLOGIES USED :
Python, Pandas,NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Scikit-learn (sklearn),Matplotlib, Seaborn

CONCLUSION :
This project demonstrates the application of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) for customer segmentation based on movie reviews. By preprocessing text data, extracting features, and applying clustering techniques, the project aims to provide insights into sentiment patterns and customer preferences within the movie review dataset.
